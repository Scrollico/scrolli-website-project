# Always Check Existing Working Code First

## CRITICAL RULE

**NEVER rewrite code from scratch without first checking if a working version exists.**

## When Fixing or Rebuilding Components

1. **First Step**: Check GitHub repository, previous commits, or any reference implementation
2. **Second Step**: Understand what was working before
3. **Third Step**: Identify the EXACT problem (not assumptions)
4. **Fourth Step**: Make minimal, targeted fixes
5. **Last Resort**: Only rewrite if absolutely necessary AND after understanding the working version

## Why This Matters

- Saves tokens
- Saves time
- Prevents introducing new bugs
- Maintains working functionality
- Shows respect for existing code

## Example of What NOT to Do

❌ **WRONG**: User says "fix VideoSection.tsx" → Immediately rewrite from scratch
✅ **RIGHT**: User says "fix VideoSection.tsx" → Check GitHub for working version → Compare → Identify issue → Fix minimally

## Commands to Check Existing Code

```bash
# Check GitHub repository
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[org]/[repo]/[branch]/[path]

# Check git history
git log --oneline [file]
git show [commit]:[file]

# Check for similar files
find . -name "*[similar-name]*"
```

## Remember

**Working code > Perfect code. Always preserve what works.**
