# Progress

- Implemented: Typography scale uplift in `lib/design-tokens.ts` (6xl/5xl/4xl), added `headingDecor.underline`.
- Updated: Editor’s Picks heading in `components/sections/home/Section1.tsx` now uses tokens (no manual sizes).
- Pending: Audit other headings/sections for hardcoded font sizes/weights; ensure design-token usage and dark-mode validation.
